The aim of CoolBeans is to enable the construction of multi-metabolite
signatures of dietary scores that could serve as biomarkers. These
biomarkers, in turn, can facilitate the targeting of precision nutrition
strategies to improve health and reduce disease risk.

CoolBeans introduces functions for preprocessing, spliting and building
the multi-metabolite signatures.
